              <p>We are Whispurr! A team of 5 students who created Campused to help out students when it comes to moving into our out of their campus dorm at UBC. 
                  <br/>Students already have a lot on their plate, so why not take some of the stress out of their lives by smoothing the process of finding a dorm and furniture when starting your courses at school! Campused allows for cheap deals for furniture and quickly allows you to get settled into a dorm so you can make focusing on your studies your top priority. And best of all, everything is $100 or less!
